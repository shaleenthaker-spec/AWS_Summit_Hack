   ```

### Step 5: Configure Mobile App

1. **Get API Gateway URL** from the deployment output
2. **Update configuration** in `src/config/aws.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const AWS_CONFIG = {
     apiGatewayUrl: 'https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod',
     // ... rest of config
   };
   ```

### Step 6: Run the App

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In a new terminal, run iOS app

- **Search Screen**: Find services by type or location
- **Profile Screen**: App settings and preferences

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"node not found"**
   - Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org
   - Restart Terminal after installation

2. **"pod not found"**
   - Install CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
   - Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory

3. **Metro bundler issues**
   ```bash
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

4. **iOS build issues**
   - Open `ios/tempapp.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Clean build folder (Product â†’ Clean Build Folder)
   - Try building again

5. **AWS deployment issues**
   - Check AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions
   - Check the AWS region is correct

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the README.md and other .md files
- **AWS Issues**: See AWS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- **Backend Issues**: See BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md
- **No Auth Setup**: See NO_AUTH_AWS_GUIDE.md

## ðŸ“± Testing the App

### Test Location Services
1. Allow location permissions when prompted
2. Verify your location appears on the home screen
3. Check that nearby services are fetched

### Test AWS Integration
1. Ensure backend is deployed and running
2. Check that services appear in the app
3. Try submitting a rating/review

### Test Voice Control
1. Tap the voice button
2. Say commands like "Find bathrooms nearby"
3. Verify voice commands work

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

If everything is working:
- âœ… App launches without errors
- âœ… Location services work
- âœ… Nearby services are displayed
- âœ… AWS backend responds to requests
- âœ… Voice control is functional

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Customize the app** for your needs
2. **Add more services** to the database
3. **Deploy to app stores** when ready
4. **Set up monitoring** and analytics
5. **Add more features** like offline mode

## ðŸ’° Cost Management

The app is designed to be cost-effective:
- **Monthly cost**: ~$4 for typical usage
