# ðŸš½ Lavatory Finder - System Architecture Presentation
## 5-Minute Technical Overview

---

## **Slide 1: Introduction & Problem Statement** (30 seconds)

**"Good [morning/afternoon], I'm here to present the system architecture of Lavatory Finder - a mobile and web application designed to help users find nearby lavatory services including bathrooms, water fountains, hand sanitizer dispensers, and sinks."**

**"The core problem we're solving is the lack of easily accessible information about public hygiene facilities, especially important in our post-pandemic world where cleanliness and accessibility are paramount."**

**"Our solution provides real-time location-based service discovery with user reviews, ratings, and comprehensive facility information - all without requiring user accounts for maximum accessibility."**

---

## **Slide 2: High-Level Architecture Overview** (45 seconds)

**"Let me walk you through our system architecture, which follows a modern, scalable, and cost-effective design pattern."**

**"At the frontend, we have two client applications:**
- **React Native mobile app** for iOS and Android
- **Web application** built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for browser access

**"The backend is built on AWS serverless architecture, consisting of:**
- **Amazon API Gateway** for REST API endpoints
- **AWS Lambda functions** for business logic
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for data storage
- **Amazon S3** for image storage

**"This architecture provides several key benefits:**
- **No authentication required** - users can start immediately
- **Device-based tracking** prevents duplicate reviews
- **Serverless scaling** handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Cost-effective** at approximately $4 per month for typical usage"

---

## **Slide 3: Frontend Architecture** (60 seconds)

**"Let's dive deeper into our frontend architecture, starting with the mobile application."**

**"The React Native app uses a component-based architecture with:**
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with bottom tabs and stack navigation
- **State Management**: React Context for location and voice control
- **Location Services**: React Native Geolocation Service for GPS integration
- **Voice Control**: React Native Voice for hands-free operation
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for device ID and preferences

**"The web version, currently running on localhost:3000, provides:**
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Browser geolocation API** for location services
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities for offline functionality
- **Real-time updates** without page refreshes

**"Both frontends share the same core functionality:**
- Service discovery and filtering
- Location-based search
- User reviews and ratings
- Interactive maps and navigation
- Voice control integration"

## **Slide 4: Backend Architecture & Data Flow** (75 seconds)

**"Now let's examine our AWS backend architecture and data flow."**

**"The backend follows a microservices pattern with four main Lambda functions:**

**1. Find Nearby Services Function:**
- Receives GPS coordinates and search radius
- Queries DynamoDB for facilities within the specified area
- Calculates distances using the Haversine formula
- Returns sorted results by proximity

**2. Create Facility Function:**
- Handles new facility submissions
- Validates facility data and coordinates
- Stores facility information in DynamoDB
- Supports facility types: bathrooms, water fountains, hand sanitizers, and sinks

**3. Submit Rating Function:**
- Processes user ratings and reviews
- Uses device ID for anonymous user tracking
- Prevents duplicate reviews from the same device
- Updates facility rating averages in real-time

**4. Image Upload Function:**
- Handles photo uploads for facilities and reviews
- Stores images in S3 with proper naming conventions
- Returns public URLs for image access

**"Data flows through API Gateway, which provides:**
- CORS handling for web applications
- Request/response transformation
- Rate limiting and security
- Automatic scaling based on demand"

## **Slide 5: Database Design & Security** (60 seconds)

**"Our database design prioritizes performance, scalability, and privacy."**

**"DynamoDB table structure includes:**

**Facilities Table:**
- Primary key: facilityId (UUID)
- Global Secondary Index on facilityType for filtering
- Location index for geographic queries
- Pay-per-request billing for cost optimization

**Reviews Table:**
- Primary key: reviewId (UUID)
- Global Secondary Index on serviceId and deviceId
- Prevents duplicate reviews from same device
- Anonymous user tracking with device-based IDs

**"Security and privacy features:**
- **No personal data collection** - only device IDs
- **Anonymous usernames** generated from device ID
- **No cross-device tracking** - each device is independent
- **Local storage** for user preferences
- **HTTPS encryption** for all API communications

**"The system generates unique device IDs using:**
- Platform information (iOS/Android)
- Screen dimensions
- Timestamp and random data
- Base64 encoding for consistency"

---

## **Slide 6: Deployment & Scalability** (45 seconds)

**"Our deployment strategy ensures reliability and scalability."**

**"AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) handles:**
- Infrastructure as Code for consistent deployments
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Environment-specific configurations
- Easy rollback capabilities

**"The system scales automatically:**
- **Lambda functions** scale from 0 to thousands of concurrent executions
- **DynamoDB** handles millions of requests per second
- **API Gateway** manages traffic spikes seamlessly
- **S3** provides unlimited storage for images

**"Cost optimization features:**
- **Pay-per-use pricing** - only pay for actual usage
- **Free tier benefits** for development and testing
- **Automatic scaling down** during low usage periods
- **Estimated monthly cost**: $4 for typical usage patterns

**"Monitoring and observability:**
- CloudWatch logs for debugging
- X-Ray tracing for performance analysis
- Custom metrics for business insights
- Automated error alerting"

## **Slide 7: Current Status & Demo** (45 seconds)

**"Let me show you what we have working right now."**

**"Currently running on localhost:3000, our web application demonstrates:**
- Real-time location services using browser geolocation
- Interactive service search and filtering
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Mock data with 6 sample facilities in San Francisco area

**"The mobile app is ready for deployment with:**
- Complete React Native implementation
- iOS and Android compatibility
- Voice control integration
- Offline capability with cached data

**"Next steps for full deployment:**
1. Deploy AWS backend using SAM templates
2. Populate DynamoDB with real facility data
3. Configure API Gateway endpoints
4. Test end-to-end functionality
5. Deploy to app stores

**"The architecture is production-ready and can handle real-world usage patterns while maintaining our core principles of accessibility, privacy, and cost-effectiveness."**
